**Growcery** is an e-commerce platform built using the Spring Boot framework and MySQL database. It allows customers to add products to their cart by describing their health conditions, enabling personalized recommendations for a healthier lifestyle.

Customers can:
- Browse and add products to their cart based on health preferences.
- Get product suggestions aligned with their dietary and wellness needs.

Admins can:
- Manage products and inventory.
- Review customer orders and manage the store efficiently.

Change the API KEY in `application.properties` and the system is ready to run.
